				<![CDATA[<p>As a forward-thinking organisation committed to ethical business practices, we are pleased to announce the that our 2023 Annual Transparency Act Report has now been published, highlighting our adherence to Norwegian laws and commitment to transparency, accountability, and human rights within our operations and supply chain.</p>
<p>Norway&#8217;s Transparency Act mandates that businesses disclose their efforts to respect fundamental human rights and prevent adverse impacts. The 2023 report is a reflection of our core values and showcases the strides we have made in aligning our operations with these rigorous standards. It is publicly accessible, allowing stakeholders to review our progress and hold us accountable.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Highlights</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Human Rights Due Diligence<br />
</strong>Gearbulk has conducted thorough due diligence to identify, assess, and mitigate human rights risks in our operations and supply chains, ensuring transparent and ethical practices.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Reporting and Metrics<br />
</strong>Our report provides an in-depth analysis of our human rights performance, adopting the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) for robust and globally recognized reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Stakeholder Engagement<br />
</strong>Gearbulk has strengthened engagement with employees, suppliers, and communities to ensure that human rights concerns are effectively addressed, fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Awareness Programs<br />
</strong>Extensive training programs emphasising the importance of human rights have been implemented in order to equip our workforce with the knowledge to uphold these values.</p>
<p><strong>Grievance Mechanisms and Remediation<br />
</strong>Robust grievance mechanisms are in place to allow affected individuals to report concerns and access remediation, reinforcing our commitment to accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2023 Annual Transparency Act Report marks a significant step in our journey towards greater transparency and accountability. By aligning with Norwegian laws and regulations, we reaffirm our commitment to ethical business practices and the promotion of human rights.</p>
<p>We invite all stakeholders to review our report and join us in promoting human rights.</p>

				<![CDATA[<h5><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans';">CH-Pfäffikon, 08 April 2024 &#8211; Gearbulk has signed a contract for delivery of up to four ammonia/ methanol-ready, 82,300 dwt Open Hatch newbuildings. The contract is firm for two vessels, with an option to purchase a further two.</span></strong></span></h5>
<p>The company has secured financing for the vessels, and CSSC Huangpu Wenchong Longxue shipyard will deliver the first two vessels in the first half of 2027. These orders represent the first step of the company’s newbuilding programme, and form part of an ambitious fleet development and renewal plan to meet our customers’ needs and future emission targets.</p>
<p>“This contract for four newbuildings marks a significant milestone for Gearbulk as these vessels are set to be the largest and most efficient in the company’s history,&#8221; says Kristian Jebsen, CEO, Gearbulk Holding AG.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this investment, we are not only enhancing our operational efficiency but also reaffirming our dedication to meeting the evolving needs of global trade. It&#8217;s a proud moment for Gearbulk, and we look forward to the positive impact these vessels will bring to our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-241925 size-large" src="https://149535964.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/G2-Ocean-80-000T-TBN-Arrow-Bow-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://149535964.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/G2-Ocean-80-000T-TBN-Arrow-Bow-980x551.jpg 980w , https://149535964.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/G2-Ocean-80-000T-TBN-Arrow-Bow-480x270.jpg 480w " sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><strong>Pulpmax</strong><br />
The ammonia / methanol ready, open hatch ships will have eight holds /hatches and four electro-hydraulic jib cranes with safe working load (SWL) lifting capacity of 2x 75 metric tonnes and 2x 120 metric tonnes. Dedicated deck space on either side of the accommodation has been incorporated into the design for the future installation of fuel tanks for alternative fuels. With a length overall of 225 meters and beam of 36 meters, this new vessel design has been designated as a ‘Pulpmax’.</p>
<p>The newbuildings will not only strengthen Gearbulk’s business, but also serve as a catalyst for the growth and success of G2 Ocean by providing enhanced cargo handling capabilities and greater flexibility in their service offering. Furthermore, these newbuildings signify Gearbulk’s commitment to environmental sustainability as they are equipped with technologies aimed at reducing emissions and minimising environmental impact.</p>
<p>The four new ships will be commercially operated by G2 Ocean and will trade alongside newbuilding sister vessels recently ordered by Gearbulk’s joint venture partner, Grieg Maritime Group. The strategic alignment of the newbuildings’ design not only fosters synergy between the respective fleets but also promotes collaboration and ultimately strengthens G2 Ocean’s position in the market. The ships’ design makes the vessels very well suited in the G2 Ocean long-haul pulp core trades, while simultaneously strengthening G2 Ocean’s overall capacity and enhanced ability to provide a best-in-class service offering to its customers.</p>
<p><strong>About Gearbulk</strong><br />
Gearbulk is a world-leading player in the open hatch bulk shipping segment, controlling a combined fleet of about 65 open hatch and other specialised vessels. The fleet is commercially operated by G2 Ocean, where Gearbulk is the majority owner.</p>

<p>The Transparency Act entered into force in July 2022 with the purpose of promoting businesses&#8217; respect for basic human rights and decent working conditions in connection with the production of goods and the provision of services.

This is in line with our strategic objective to enhance governance and promote responsible business practices.</p>
<p>​​​​​​Releasing our first Transparency Act Annual Account is an important milestone in our ESG journey and demonstrates our firm commitment to respecting human rights. We believe that by being open and honest about our progress, we can build trust with our stakeholders and drive positive change in our industry.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>On 20th December 2022 Gearbulk Shipowning Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Gearbulk Holding AG, entered into a 5-year USD 245,250,000 sustainability-linked revolving credit and term loan facility (the “Facility”), with a syndicate led by DNB Bank ASA as bookrunner, agent and sustainability coordinator and with Nordea, SR Bank, Sparebanken Vest and Swedbank as mandated lead arrangers. Norton Rose Fulbright acted as legal counsel for the lenders and Stephenson Harwood for the borrower. The Facility is secured by a fleet of 12 open hatch vessels. Proceeds from the Facility will be used to refinance an existing bank facility and to take out certain sale- and leaseback facilities.</p>
<p>The Facility is the first sustainability-linked financing of the Gearbulk group. The margin is linked to the compliance with certain pre-defined trajectory levels of two key performance indicators; annual efficiency ratio (“AER”) measuring CO2 emissions and total recordable injury cases frequency (“TRCF”). AER measures CO2 emissions intensity in accordance with IMO definitions . TRCF is a measurement of all injuries save for first aid cases.</p>
<p>Gearbulk is a long term, world leading player in the open hatch bulk shipping segment, controlling a combined fleet of about 70 open hatch, other specialized and conventional vessels. The fleet is commercially operated by the G2 Ocean pool, where Gearbulk is the majority owner.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p><strong>Gearbulk joins forces with more than 450 companies and organisations to help resolve the humanitarian crisis that has left 400,000 seafarers stranded onboard ships around the world.</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significant impacts on seafarers around the world. To prevent virus infection, many countries have imposed bans or restrictions on travel and crew changes, making it difficult for seafarers to join their ships or return home.</p>
<p>In December 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced that approximately 400,000 seafarers are stranded on ships beyond the expiry of their contracts, while another 400.000 seafarers were unable to get to work.</p>
<p>To protect the rights and wellbeing of the seafarers, Gearbulk signed the Neptune Declaration on Seafarers Wellbeing and Crew Change – a global call to action to end the ongoing crew change crisis.</p>
<p>The Maritime Industry Crew Change Taskforce developed the declaration after the Global Maritime Forum&#8217;s 2020 Virtual High-Level Meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Commits for 4 Key Actions</strong></p>
<p>The declaration is a joint global &#8220;call to action&#8221; to revitalise and underline the ongoing crewing crisis. It focuses on actions needed to ensure crew changes and safeguard global supply chains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognise seafarers as key workers and give them priority access to Covid-19 vaccines.</li>
<li>Establish and implement a gold standard health protocol based on existing best practice.</li>
<li>Increase collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes.</li>
<li>Ensure airline connectivity between key marine hubs for seafarers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The present situation for seafarers worldwide clearly shows that they have not yet received the status of being Key Workers. The challenges continue, both related to legislation and actions taken in port, and actions taken by cargo owners and charterers.</p>
<p>The Neptune Declaration is developed by The Maritime Industry Crew Change Taskforce which consists of organisations such as the Global Maritime Forum, International Chamber of Shipping, International Maritime Employers’ Council, and the World Economic Forum.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Gearbulk launches new cost reduction measures to adapt business model to continued weak dry bulk markets and interruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic</strong></p>
<p>The latest cost reduction measure initiated by Gearbulk is the renegotiation of charter rates with Japanese shipowners who have their vessels on long term charters to the company. As an industrial tonnage provider, Gearbulk needs at all times to operate a competitive fleet balanced with cargo commitments; a number of the charter contracts made in earlier years are based on newbuilding prices and rates which are no longer sustainable going forward.</p>
<p>“The unforeseen and unfortunate pandemic crisis adds further strain on an already difficult international business environment, and everyone needs to adjust their expectations and adapt to this new reality. It is &#8216;adapt quickly or die slowly&#8217;,” says Chairman Kristian Jebsen.</p>
<p>“The recent negative development comes on top of a grim dry cargo shipping market that has struggled with unsustainably low freight rates for several years. The business of Gearbulk, like most other international shipping companies, is also negatively affected by this situation. Although the challenges are caused by events beyond our control and influence, we continue to identify and impose any measure within our power to fight the challenges, with the view to protect the business and safeguard the future interests of our employees, business partners and other stakeholders,” Jebsen says.</p>
<p>The company has over the last few years implemented effective counter-measures through a substantial cost reduction program, a wide-reaching organizational restructuring, a bank debt rescheduling as well as a sale and lease-back program for several vessels in the Gearbulk fleet.</p>
<p>In addition to such cost savings and continued financial backing from its owners, the K. Jebsen family and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), Gearbulk has taken the lead in industry consolidation by forming the world’s largest pool of open hatch carriers. The G2 Ocean pool was put together with Grieg Star Shipping for the marketing and operation of the two companies&#8217; combined fleets. This initiative has been very successful and provides the customers with greater flexibility, reliability and competitive freight rates through the combined reputation of Gearbulk and Grieg Star, the experienced and professional G2 Ocean organization and the world&#8217;s largest fleet of open hatch vessels.</p>
<p>“I think we have to realize that the current challenging climate, abound with uncertainties and unpredictability, will continue for the foreseeable future. Nobody is immune to the negative effects of this disruption, and everyone exposed to international trade will have to review their business model and the financial exposure from deals made in earlier years,” says Jebsen.</p>
<p>“We trust our Japanese partners will support this measure and adapt to this new reality, as other stakeholders in Gearbulk are doing,” Jebsen says.</p>
<p>Gearbulk is a long term, world leading player in the open hatch bulk shipping segment, controlling a combined fleet of about 70 open hatch, other specialized and conventional vessels. The fleet is commercially operated by the G2 Ocean pool, where Gearbulk is the majority owner.</p>
