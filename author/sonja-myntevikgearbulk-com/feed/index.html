				<![CDATA[<p>As a forward-thinking organisation committed to ethical business practices, we are pleased to announce the that our 2023 Annual Transparency Act Report has now been published, highlighting our adherence to Norwegian laws and commitment to transparency, accountability, and human rights within our operations and supply chain.</p>
<p>Norway&#8217;s Transparency Act mandates that businesses disclose their efforts to respect fundamental human rights and prevent adverse impacts. The 2023 report is a reflection of our core values and showcases the strides we have made in aligning our operations with these rigorous standards. It is publicly accessible, allowing stakeholders to review our progress and hold us accountable.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Highlights</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Human Rights Due Diligence<br />
</strong>Gearbulk has conducted thorough due diligence to identify, assess, and mitigate human rights risks in our operations and supply chains, ensuring transparent and ethical practices.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Reporting and Metrics<br />
</strong>Our report provides an in-depth analysis of our human rights performance, adopting the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) for robust and globally recognized reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Stakeholder Engagement<br />
</strong>Gearbulk has strengthened engagement with employees, suppliers, and communities to ensure that human rights concerns are effectively addressed, fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Awareness Programs<br />
</strong>Extensive training programs emphasising the importance of human rights have been implemented in order to equip our workforce with the knowledge to uphold these values.</p>
<p><strong>Grievance Mechanisms and Remediation<br />
</strong>Robust grievance mechanisms are in place to allow affected individuals to report concerns and access remediation, reinforcing our commitment to accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2023 Annual Transparency Act Report marks a significant step in our journey towards greater transparency and accountability. By aligning with Norwegian laws and regulations, we reaffirm our commitment to ethical business practices and the promotion of human rights.</p>
<p>We invite all stakeholders to review our report and join us in promoting human rights.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>Gearbulk is proud to release its 2023 Annual Reporting suite, marking an important milestone in the Company’s ongoing commitment to transparency, sustainability, and corporate responsibility. The reporting suite, consisting of our Integrated Report, ESG Report and Financial Statements, encapsulates our dedication to operating ethically, minimising our environmental footprint, and maximising our positive impact on society.</p>
<p>The theme for this year&#8217;s reporting suite is ‘Propelling Forward,’ representing our commitment to creating long-term value by taking responsibility for the future through the choices we make today. Assessing our impacts, both positive and negative and adjusting our strategy accordingly is imperative to ensuring a sustainable business.</p>
<p>Our 2023 reports showcase a series of enhancements aimed at providing our stakeholders with a deeper understanding of our performance and progress over the past year. Through improved content, accuracy, and presentation, Gearbulk strives to offer comprehensive insights into our operations and initiatives.</p>
<p>One significant achievement highlighted in our 2023 reports is that Gearbulk is now reporting in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. By adhering to these internationally recognised guidelines, we ensure that our reporting meets the highest standards of transparency and accountability, allowing for meaningful comparisons and assessments of our sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>“Gearbulk remains steadfast in our commitment to openness and integrity. Our alignment with the GRI standard not only strengthens our position as responsible corporate citizens but also underscores our dedication to making a positive impact on the world. This milestone further solidifies our pledge to open communication and responsible business practices, ensuring transparency and accountability in all our endeavours,” says Kristian Jebsen, CEO and Chairman of Gearbulk Holding AG.</p>

				<![CDATA[<h5><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans';">CH-Pfäffikon, 08 April 2024 &#8211; Gearbulk has signed a contract for delivery of up to four ammonia/ methanol-ready, 82,300 dwt Open Hatch newbuildings. The contract is firm for two vessels, with an option to purchase a further two.</span></strong></span></h5>
<p>The company has secured financing for the vessels, and CSSC Huangpu Wenchong Longxue shipyard will deliver the first two vessels in the first half of 2027. These orders represent the first step of the company’s newbuilding programme, and form part of an ambitious fleet development and renewal plan to meet our customers’ needs and future emission targets.</p>
<p>“This contract for four newbuildings marks a significant milestone for Gearbulk as these vessels are set to be the largest and most efficient in the company’s history,&#8221; says Kristian Jebsen, CEO, Gearbulk Holding AG.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this investment, we are not only enhancing our operational efficiency but also reaffirming our dedication to meeting the evolving needs of global trade. It&#8217;s a proud moment for Gearbulk, and we look forward to the positive impact these vessels will bring to our customers.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Pulpmax</strong><br />
The ammonia / methanol ready, open hatch ships will have eight holds /hatches and four electro-hydraulic jib cranes with safe working load (SWL) lifting capacity of 2x 75 metric tonnes and 2x 120 metric tonnes. Dedicated deck space on either side of the accommodation has been incorporated into the design for the future installation of fuel tanks for alternative fuels. With a length overall of 225 meters and beam of 36 meters, this new vessel design has been designated as a ‘Pulpmax’.</p>
<p>The newbuildings will not only strengthen Gearbulk’s business, but also serve as a catalyst for the growth and success of G2 Ocean by providing enhanced cargo handling capabilities and greater flexibility in their service offering. Furthermore, these newbuildings signify Gearbulk’s commitment to environmental sustainability as they are equipped with technologies aimed at reducing emissions and minimising environmental impact.</p>
<p>The four new ships will be commercially operated by G2 Ocean and will trade alongside newbuilding sister vessels recently ordered by Gearbulk’s joint venture partner, Grieg Maritime Group. The strategic alignment of the newbuildings’ design not only fosters synergy between the respective fleets but also promotes collaboration and ultimately strengthens G2 Ocean’s position in the market. The ships’ design makes the vessels very well suited in the G2 Ocean long-haul pulp core trades, while simultaneously strengthening G2 Ocean’s overall capacity and enhanced ability to provide a best-in-class service offering to its customers.</p>
<p><strong>About Gearbulk</strong><br />
Gearbulk is a world-leading player in the open hatch bulk shipping segment, controlling a combined fleet of about 65 open hatch and other specialised vessels. The fleet is commercially operated by G2 Ocean, where Gearbulk is the majority owner.</p>

<p>The Transparency Act entered into force in July 2022 with the purpose of promoting businesses&#8217; respect for basic human rights and decent working conditions in connection with the production of goods and the provision of services. In addition, the general public shall be ensured access to information about how businesses deal with the negative consequences of these rights. ​​​​​​​As a responsible and forward-thinking organisation, we are dedicated to meeting the expectations of this important legislation.</p>
<p>The Transparency Act Annual Account provides a comprehensive overview of our efforts to increase awareness and visibility on how we identify and manage actual and potential impacts on human rights. This is in line with our strategic objective to enhance governance and promote responsible business practices.</p>
<p>​​​​​​Releasing our first Transparency Act Annual Account is an important milestone in our ESG journey and demonstrates our firm commitment to respecting human rights. We believe that by being open and honest about our progress, we can build trust with our stakeholders and drive positive change in our industry.</p>

Designed to empower our stakeholders with in-depth information and valuable insights, our new report suite provides a comprehensive overview of our business and the way we analyse, interpret and visualise our annual performance.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.paperturn-view.com/?pid=MzE319512" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-241384" src="https://149535964.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Integrated-report-cover-724x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="424" />     </a><a href="https://www.paperturn-view.com/?pid=MzE319475&amp;v=1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-241411" src="https://149535964.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ESG-report-cover-724x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="424" />     </a></p>

				<![CDATA[<p>On 20th December 2022 Gearbulk Shipowning Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Gearbulk Holding AG, entered into a 5-year USD 245,250,000 sustainability-linked revolving credit and term loan facility (the “Facility”), with a syndicate led by DNB Bank ASA as bookrunner, agent and sustainability coordinator and with Nordea, SR Bank, Sparebanken Vest and Swedbank as mandated lead arrangers. Norton Rose Fulbright acted as legal counsel for the lenders and Stephenson Harwood for the borrower. The Facility is secured by a fleet of 12 open hatch vessels. Proceeds from the Facility will be used to refinance an existing bank facility and to take out certain sale- and leaseback facilities.</p>
<p>The Facility is the first sustainability-linked financing of the Gearbulk group. The margin is linked to the compliance with certain pre-defined trajectory levels of two key performance indicators; annual efficiency ratio (“AER”) measuring CO2 emissions and total recordable injury cases frequency (“TRCF”). AER measures CO2 emissions intensity in accordance with IMO definitions . TRCF is a measurement of all injuries save for first aid cases.</p>
<p>Gearbulk is a long term, world leading player in the open hatch bulk shipping segment, controlling a combined fleet of about 70 open hatch, other specialized and conventional vessels. The fleet is commercially operated by the G2 Ocean pool, where Gearbulk is the majority owner.</p>
